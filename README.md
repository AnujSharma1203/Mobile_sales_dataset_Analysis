## 📘 Project Overview  

When I started exploring the mobile dataset, it wasn’t just about numbers — it was about understanding **why some devices cost more than others**.  

This Power BI project, *Mobile Dataset Sales Analysis*, breaks down how **mobile features like RAM, camera quality, battery capacity, and processor type** shape the **launched price** of devices across major global brands.  

The goal? To turn technical specifications into **market stories** — revealing how brands position themselves, what features they prioritize, and how pricing reflects value perception.

## 🎯 Objective  

- Uncover the **relationship between features and pricing** across global smartphone brands.  
- Analyze **which specifications drive higher market value**.  
- Provide **multi-currency insights** to compare regional pricing strategies.  
- Help identify **premium vs. budget segment trends** in the mobile industry.

### **3. Feature vs Price Dashboard**  
Here’s where the story gets interesting.  
This page connects **hardware features to their price points**, letting you filter by RAM, camera, or processor and instantly see the pricing impact.  
It also converts prices across **INR, USD, PKR, CNY, and AED**, showing how global markets react to similar features differently.  

**Insight:** Devices with 8GB–16GB RAM see a massive jump in price, especially among Apple and Huawei models — a clear indicator of how performance sells.
